My research interest is on probablistic high-dimensionality reduction and its application in anatomical surfaces in biology (for example, teeth). My advisor is [Ingrid Daubechies](https://math.duke.edu/people/ingrid-daubechies). This site is still under construction. Please come back again for updates on my research projects.
