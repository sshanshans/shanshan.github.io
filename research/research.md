My research interest is on image processing and its applications in arts. The mathematical tools Iâ€™m using are wavelets, random matrices, and harmonic analysis. My advisor is [Ingrid Daubechies](https://math.duke.edu/people/ingrid-daubechies). This site is still under constructions. Please come back again for more updates on my research projects.
