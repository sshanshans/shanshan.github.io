title: Introduction to fair division and cake-cutting algorithms
description: course webpage
--- 

### Course Description and Obejctives
How many times did you share a cake with your family and friends while envying someone who got a better piece than yours? Is there a way to cut cake fairly so that everyone is satisfied? Mathematicians and computer scientists have been intrigued by this fair division problem and proposing algorithms to solve it. However, other real life problems can be more complicated than cutting a cake. How to share apartment rent with your roommate? How to split a taxi fare among riders heading to different locations? We will look at different aspects of sharing by case study and introduce the corresponding basic math concepts and their applications.

We will focus on problem solving skills with tools from graph theory, number theory, complexity, and combinatorial topology. But the most important thing is to have fun playing with mathematics!

### Agenda
I.  Simple fair sharing: existence, algorithm and complexity
Day 1 - What is (simple) fair division
Day 2 - Graph theory in simple fair division
Day 3 - How many cuts are needed

II. Some variations on the themes of fair division
Day 4 - Unequal share
Day 5 - Envy-free fair division
Day 6 - Approximate division
