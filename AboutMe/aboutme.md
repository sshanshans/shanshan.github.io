![me](/images/shanshan.jpg)

I grew up in Tsingtao, a coastal city in China. My name in Chinese characters is 单珊. I went to Agnes Scott College, where I became a mathematician, art lover, and feminist. During college, I spent a year in Hungary for the Budapest Semester in Mathematics. In 2014, I graduated *summa cum laude* from Agnes Scott with a BA in mathematics.  
After college, I became a graduate student in mathematics at Duke University, where I worked on some geometry processing and statistical shape analysis. In 2019, I received my PhD, with a thesis advised by Ingrid Daubechies on probabilistic models on fiber bundles. In 2019-2020, I was a post-doc researcher at Duke. 

Besides doing math,

* I like to powerlift. <br />
     + deadlift: 225lbs <br />
     + squat: 165lbs <br /> 
<br />
* I like to read, and here are some authors I read often. <br />
     + [Haruki Murakami](http://www.harukimurakami.com): I recommend all of them. Indeed, nobody knows me better than him. <br />
     + Dostoyevski: Brothers K is my favorite.  <br />
     + Orhan Pamuk <br />
<br />
* I like other things as well. <br />
