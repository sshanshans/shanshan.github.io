#### Research: Overview

My research focuses on problems in diffusion geometry and Bayesian statistics, that are motivated
by the open challenges of extracting stable and interpretable information from high-dimensional
data. On the theory side, I build algorithms and probabilistic models on geometric objects for
dimension reduction, inference, regression and related machine learning problems. On the applied
side, I use my work on anatomical surfaces (typically, teeth and bones of primates) to gain insights about evolutionary processes. On the implementation side, I develop robust and easy-to-use
software to bridge the gap between research and practice.
